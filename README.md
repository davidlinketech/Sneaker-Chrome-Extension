# Sneaker-Chrome-Extension

Chrome-Extension that I made a few months ago, that helps to checkout limited sneakers on sites like Zalando.

## How to use:

-load extension into chrome browser (or on mobile into "kiwi browser")

-open popup page and change settings (delays need to be set for it to work)

-go to a shoepage on zalando/snipes, select sizes and click start  (on drops you need to do a preload)
